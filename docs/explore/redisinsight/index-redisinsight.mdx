RedisInsight is an intuitive and efficient GUI for Redis, allowing you to interact with your databases and manage your data—with built-in support for most popular Redis modules. The free non-commercial add-on provides tools to analyze the memory, profile the performance of your database, and guide you toward better Redis usage.

RedisInsight provides built-in support for the RedisJSON, RediSearch, RedisGraph, Redis Streams, and RedisTimeSeries modules to make it even easier to query, visualize, and interactively manipulate search indexes, graphs, streams, and time-series data. Used properly, RedisInsight can make the experience of using modules with Redis Enterprise Cloud Essentials even smoother. 

A full-featured desktop GUI client, RedisInsight is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux and is fully compatible with Redis Enterprise. It works with any cloud provider as long as you run it on a host with network access to your cloud-based Redis server. RedisInsight makes it easy to discover cloud databases and configure connection details with a single click. It allows you to automatically add Redis Enterprise Software and Redis Enterprise Cloud databases.

<TabItem value="Docker">



The first step is to install docker for your operating system. Run the docker version command in a terminal window to make sure that docker is installed correctly.

Note - On Windows and Mac, install docker version 18.03 or higher. You can run docker version to find out your docker version.

## Run RedisInsight Docker image 

Next, run the RedisInsight container. The easiest way is to run the following command:

```
docker run -v redisinsight:/db -p 8001:8001 redislabs/redisinsight:latest
```

and then point your browser to http://localhost:8001.

RedisInsight also provides a health check endpoint at http://localhost:8001/healthcheck/ to monitor the health of the running container.

Note: Make sure the directory you pass as a volume to the container has necessary permissions for the container to access it. For example, if the previous command returns a permissions error, run the following command:

```
chown -R 1001 redisinsight
```

In addition, you can add some additional flags to the docker run command:

You can add the -it flag to see the logs and view the progress.

On Linux, you can add --network host. This makes it easy to work with redis running on your local machine.

To analyze RDB files stored in S3, you can add the access key and secret access key as environment variables using the -e flag.

For example: -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY=aws_access_key -e AWS_SECRET_KEY=aws_secret_access_key

If everything worked, you should see the following output in the terminal:

```
Starting webserver...
Visit http://0.0.0.0:8001 in your web browser.
Press CTRL-C to exit.
```


Head over to your web browser and go to http://localhost:8001

Congratulations! You have successfully installed RedisInsight and are now ready to inspect your Redis data, monitor database health, and perform runtime server configuration with this browser-based management interface for your Redis deployment.

## Create the RedisInsight deployment and service 

Below is an annotated YAML file that will create a RedisInsight deployment and a service in a k8s cluster.

### Create a new file redisinsight.yaml with the content below

```
# RedisInsight service with name 'redisinsight-service'
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: redisinsight-service       # name should not be 'redisinsight'
                                   # since the service creates
                                   # environment variables that
                                   # conflicts with redisinsight
                                   # application's environment
                                   # variables `REDISINSIGHT_HOST` and
                                   # `REDISINSIGHT_PORT`
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 8001
  selector:
    app: redisinsight
---
## RedisInsight deployment with name 'redisinsight'
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: redisinsight #deployment name
  labels:
    app: redisinsight #deployment label
spec:
  replicas: 1 #a single replica pod
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: redisinsight #which pods is the deployment managing, as defined by the pod template
  template: #pod template
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: redisinsight #label for pod/s
    spec:
      containers:

      - name:  redisinsight #Container name (DNS_LABEL, unique)
        image: redislabs/redisinsight:1.7.0 #repo/image
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent #Always pull image
        volumeMounts:
        - name: db #Pod volumes to mount into the container's filesystem. Cannot be updated.
          mountPath: /db
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8001 #exposed conainer port and protocol
          protocol: TCP
      volumes:
      - name: db
        emptyDir: {} # node-ephemeral volume https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir
```

### Create the RedisInsight deployment and service

```
kubectl apply -f redisinsight.yaml
```

### Accessing RedisInsight

Once the deployment and service are successfully applied and complete, you shoould be able to access RedisInsight. 
This can be accomplished by listing the using the External IP address of the service we created to reach redisinsight.

```
$ kubectl get svc redisinsight-service
NAME                   CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)         AGE
redisinsight-service   <cluster-ip>     <external-ip>    80:32143/TCP    1m
```

If you are using minikube, run minikube list to list the service and access RedisInsight at http://minikube-ip:minikube-service-port.

```
$ minikube list
|-------------|----------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------|
|  NAMESPACE  |         NAME         | TARGET PORT  |           URL                               |
|-------------|----------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------|
| default     | kubernetes           | No node port |                                             |
| default     | redisinsight-service |           80 | http://minikube-ip:minikubeservice-port |
| kube-system | kube-dns             | No node port |                                             |
|-------------|----------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------|
```

### Create the RedisInsight deployment without a service. 

Below is an annotated YAML file that will create a RedisInsight deployment in a K8s cluster.

### Create a new file redisinsight.yaml with the content below

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: redisinsight #deployment name
  labels:
    app: redisinsight #deployment label
spec:
  replicas: 1 #a single replica pod
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: redisinsight #which pods is the deployment managing, as defined by the pod template
  template: #pod template
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: redisinsight #label for pod/s
    spec:
      containers:
      - name:  redisinsight #Container name (DNS_LABEL, unique)
        image: redislabs/redisinsight:1.7.0 #repo/image
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent #Always pull image
        env:
          # If there's a service named 'redisinsight' that exposes the
          # deployment, we manually set `REDISINSIGHT_HOST` and
          # `REDISINSIGHT_PORT` to override the service environment
          # variables.
          - name: REDISINSIGHT_HOST
            value: "0.0.0.0"
          - name: REDISINSIGHT_PORT
            value: "8001"
        volumeMounts:
        - name: db #Pod volumes to mount into the container's filesystem. Cannot be updated.
          mountPath: /db
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8001 #exposed conainer port and protocol
          protocol: TCP
        livenessProbe:
           httpGet:
              path : /healthcheck/ # exposed RI endpoint for healthcheck
              port: 8001 # exposed container port
           initialDelaySeconds: 5 # number of seconds to wait after the container starts to perform liveness probe
           periodSeconds: 5 # period in seconds after which liveness probe is performed
           failureThreshold: 1 # number of liveness probe failures after which container restarts
      volumes:
      - name: db
        emptyDir: {} # node-ephemeral volume https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir
```

### Create the RedisInsight deployment

```
kubectl apply -f redisinsight.yaml
```

Note - If the deployment will be exposed by a service whose name is ‘redisinsight’, set REDISINSIGHT_HOST and REDISINSIGHT_PORT environment variables to override the environment variables created by the service.

Once the deployment has been successfully applied and the deployment complete, access RedisInsight. This can be accomplished by exposing the deployment as a K8s Service or by using port forwarding, as in the example below:

```
kubectl port-forward deployment/redisinsight 8001
```

Open your browser and point to http://localhost:8001



Congratulations! You have successfully installed RedisInsight and are now ready to inspect your Redis data, monitor database health, and perform runtime server configuration with this browser-based management interface for your Redis deployment.
