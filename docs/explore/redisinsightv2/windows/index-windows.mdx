### Step 5. Overview of User database keys

Let us import a user database (6k keys). This dataset contains users stored as Redis Hashes.


### 
**Users**

The user hashes contain the following fields:



*   `user:id` : The key of the hash.
*   `first_name` : First Name.
*   `last_name` : Last name.
*   `email` : email address.
*   `gender` : Gender (male/female).
*   `ip_address` : IP address.
*   `country` : Country Name.
*   `country_code` : Country Code.
*   `city` : City of the user.
*   `longitude` : Longitude of the user.
*   `latitude` : Latitude of the user.
*   `last_login` : Epoch time of the last login.

### Step 6. Clone the repository

Open up the CLI terminal and run the following command:

 ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/redis-developer/redis-datasets
  cd redis-datasets/user-database
 ```


### Step 7. Import the user database keys

Open up the CLI terminal and run the following command.

:::note NOTE
You will need a hostname, port and password to run this for a cloud database.
:::

 ```bash
  redis-cli -h redis-15411.c264.ap-south-1-1.ec2.cloud.redislabs.com -p 15411 -a <enter your password> < ./import_users.redis
 ```


Refresh the keys view by clicking as shown below:
