### Step 1. Set up a free Redis Enterprise Cloud account

Visit [developer.redis.com/create/rediscloud/](https://developer.redis.com/create/rediscloud/) and create [a free Redis Enterprise Cloud account](https://redis.com/try-free/). Once you complete this tutorial, you will be provided with the database endpoint URL and password. Save it for future reference.

### Step 2. Install Vercel CLI 


```
npm i -g vercel

vercel -v     
Vercel CLI 23.1.2
23.1.2

```

### Step 3. Log in to your Vercel account

The ```vercel login``` command allows you to log in to your Vercel account through Vercel CLI.


```
vercel login
Vercel CLI 23.1.2
> Log in to Vercel github
> Success! GitHub authentication complete for xx@xx.com
Congratulations! You are now logged in. In order to deploy something, run `vercel`.
💡  Connect your Git Repositories to deploy every branch push automatically (https://vercel.link/git).
```


Once Vercel gets connected to your GitHub account, it displays your public repositories. Let us clone [https://github.com/redis-developer/basic-redis-chat-app-demo-nodejs](https://github.com/redis-developer/basic-redis-chat-app-demo-nodejs) to the local repository.

### Step 4. Clone the GitHub repository

The complete source code of the Redis Chat application is hosted [here](https://github.com/redis-developer/basic-redis-chat-app-demo-nodejs). React and Socket.IO are used for building the frontend while Node.js and Redis power the backend. Redis is used mainly as a database to keep the user/messages data and for sending messages between connected servers.

```
git clone https://github.com/redis-developer/basic-redis-chat-app-demo-nodejs
```


### Step 5. Create a vercel.json for Node.js app

If you run the ```vercel init``` command, it will list various frameworks but you won’t be able to find Node.js, hence you will need to create a ```vercel.json``` file as shown below:


```
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "./index.vercel.js",
      "use": "@vercel/node"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/"
    }
  ]
}

```


### Step 6. Set up environment variables

The ```vercel env``` command is used to manage [environment variables](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables) under a Project, providing functionality to list, add, remove, and pull.

Let us first set up environment variables.


```
 vercel env add
Vercel CLI 23.1.2
? What's the name of the variable? REDIS_ENDPOINT_URI
? What's the value of REDIS_ENDPOINT_URI? redis-XXXX.c110-qa.us-east-1-1-1.ec2.qa-cloud.redislabs.com:XXX

```


Listing the environment variables:


```
vercel env ls
Vercel CLI 23.1.2
> Environment Variables found in Project basic-redis-chat-app-demo-nodejs [684ms]

 name                       value               environments                        created
 REDIS_PASSWORD             Encrypted           Production, Preview, Development    2d ago
 REDIS_ENDPOINT_URL         Encrypted           Production, Preview, Development    2d ago

```


### Step 7. Deploy the Node.js app

When you run a vercel command in a directory for the first time, [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli) needs to know which [scope](https://vercel.com/docs/cli#options/global-options/scope) and [Project](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/overview) you want to deploy your directory to. You can choose to either link an existing project or create a new one.


```
vercel  
Vercel CLI 23.1.2
? Set up and deploy "~/projects/10feb/basic-redis-chat-app-demo-nodejs"? [Y/n] y
? Which scope do you want to deploy to? redis-developer
? Found project "redis-developer/basic-redis-chat-app-demo-nodejs". Link to it? [Y/n] y
🔗  Linked to redis-developer/basic-redis-chat-app-demo-nodejs (created .vercel)
🔍  Inspect: https://vercel.com/redis-developer/basic-redis-chat-app-demo-nodejs/5KZydRNsXwnjRxDYa65x4Ak8KwZT [4s]
✅  Preview: https://basic-redis-chat-app-demo-nodejs-redis-developer.vercel.app [copied to clipboard] [27s]
📝  To deploy to production (basic-redis-chat-app-demo-nodejs.vercel.app), run `vercel --prod`
❗️  Due to `builds` existing in your configuration file, the Build and Development Settings defined in your Project Settings will not apply. Learn More: https://vercel.link/unused-build-settings

```


Once the deployment process has completed, a new `.vercel` directory will be added to your directory. The `.vercel` directory contains both the organization and project ID of your project. 

The "project.json" file contains:

- The ID of the Vercel project that you linked ("projectId")

- The ID of the user or team your Vercel project is owned by ("orgId")




:::note
Vercel CLI automatically detects the framework you are using and offers default project settings accordingly.
:::

### Step 8. Accessing the app 

Run the following command to deploy the Redis chat app to the Prod environment.
```
vercel --prod
Vercel CLI 23.1.2
🔍  Inspect: https://vercel.com/redis-developer/basic-redis-chat-app-demo-nodejs/GoRdy7LKxqhBfJNW8hSvvFLQC6EN [2s]
✅  Production: https://basic-redis-chat-app-demo-nodejs.vercel.app [copied to clipboard] [14s]


```

By now, you will be able to login to Chat app and start chatting.

The chat server works as a basic REST API which involves keeping the session and handling the user state in the chat rooms (besides the WebSocket/real-time part). When a WebSocket/real-time server is instantiated, which listens for the next events:
