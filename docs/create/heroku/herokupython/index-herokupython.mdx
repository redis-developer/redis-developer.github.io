Heroku is a container-based cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS). It is a new way of building and deploying web apps. Heroku lets app developers spend 100% of their time on their application code, not managing servers, deployment, ongoing operations, or scaling. Developers use Heroku to deploy, manage, and scale modern apps. The Heroku platform is elegant, flexible, and easy to use, offering developers the simplest path to getting their apps to market.

Some of the notable features offered by Heroku are:

- Agile deployment for Node.js, Java, Python, Ruby, Go and Scala
- Run and scale any type of app
- Flexibility to customize and support unique DevOps workflow needs
- Total visibility across your entire app
- Offers a powerful dashboard and CLI

#### Step 1. Create Redis Enterprise Cloud

Redis Enterprise Cloud is a fully managed cloud service by Redis. Built for modern distributed applications, Redis Enterprise Cloud enables you to run any query, simple or complex, at sub-millisecond performance at virtually infinite scale without worrying about operational complexity or service availability. With modern probabilistic data structures and extensible data models, including Search, JSON, Graph, and Time Series, you can rely on Redis as your data-platform for all your real-time needs.

Create your free Redis Enterprise Cloud account by visiting [this link](https://redis.com/try-free)

[Follow this link to create a Redis Enterprise Cloud](/create/rediscloud) subscription and database. Once you create the database, you will be provisioned with a unique database endpoint URL, port and password. Save these for future reference.

You can use the Redis CLI to quickly verify the connection to the Redis instance URL and access the database.

### Step 2. Create a Heroku account

If you are using the Heroku platform for the first time, create your new Heroku account [through this link](https://signup.heroku.com/login).
You can refer to [Heroku documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/reference)

### Step 3. Install Heroku CLI on your system

Run the following command to install the Heroku CLI on your system.

```macos
 brew install heroku
```

### Step 4. Login to Heroku

```bash
 heroku login
 heroku: Press any key to open up the browser to login or q to exit:
 Opening browser to https://cli-auth.heroku.com/auth/cli/browser/XXXXXXXXXXA
 Logging in... done
 Logged in as your_email_address
```

### Step 5. Connect your application to Redis Enterprise Cloud

For this demonstration, we will be using a [Sample Rate Limiting application](https://github.com/redis-developer/basic-rate-limiting-demo-python).

#### Clone the repository

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/redis-developer/basic-rate-limiting-demo-python
```

Run the commands below to get a functioning Git repository that contains a simple application as well as a package.json file.

```
$ heroku create
Creating app... done, ⬢ fast-reef-76278
https://fast-reef-76278.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/fast-reef-76278.git
```

### Step 6. Setting up Environment Variables

Go to the Heroku dashboard, click "Settings" and set REDIS_ENDPOINT_URI and REDIS_PASSWORD under the Config Vars.
Refer to Step 1 for the correct values to use.

### Step 7. Deploy your code

Heroku generates a random name (in this case fast-reef-76278) for your app, or you can pass a parameter to specify your own app name.
Now deploy your code:

```
$ git push heroku
Enumerating objects: 512, done.
Counting objects: 100% (512/512), done.
Delta compression using up to 12 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (256/256), done.
Writing objects: 100% (512/512), 1.52 MiB | 660.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 512 (delta 244), reused 512 (delta 244)
remote: Compressing source files... done.

 * [new branch]      master -> master
```

### Step 8. Accessing the application

Open https://fast-reef-76278.herokuapp.com/ to see your application
