Redis Enterprise Cloud is a fully managed cloud service by Redis. Built for modern distributed applications, Redis Enterprise Cloud enables you to run any query, simple or complex, at sub-millisecond performance at virtually infinite scale without worrying about operational complexity or service availability. With modern probabilistic data structures and extensible data models, including Search, JSON, Graph, and Time Series, you can rely on Redis as your data-platform for all your real-time needs.

### Step 1. Create a free Cloud account

Create your free <a href="https://redis.com/try-free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Redis Enterprise Cloud account</a>. Once you click on “Get Started”, you will receive an email with a link to activate your account and complete your signup process.

### Step 4. Install RedisInsight

RedisInsight is a visual tool that lets you do both GUI- and CLI-based interactions with your Redis database, and so much more when developing your Redis based application. It is a fully-featured pure Desktop GUI client that provides capabilities to design, develop and optimize your Redis application. It works with any cloud provider as long as you run it on a host with network access to your cloud-based Redis server. It makes it easy to discover cloud databases and configure connection details with a single click. It allows you to automatically add Redis Enterprise Software and Redis Enterprise Cloud databases.

You can install Redis Stack on your local system to get RedisInsight GUI tool up and running. Ensure that you have `brew` package installed in your Mac system.

```bash
 brew tap redis-stack/redis-stack
 brew install --cask redis-stack
```

```
  ==> Installing Cask redis-stack-redisinsight
  ==> Moving App 'RedisInsight-preview.app' to '/Applications/RedisInsight-preview.app'
  🍺  redis-stack-redisinsight was successfully installed!
  ==> Installing Cask redis-stack
  🍺  redis-stack was successfully installed!
```

Go to Applications and click "RedisInsight-v2" to bring up the Redis Desktop GUI tool.

### Step 5. Add Redis database

### Step 8. Try Redis Stack tutorials

In this tutorial, we will go through an example of a bike shop. We will show the different capabilities of Redis Stack.

Choose "Redis Stack" in the left sidebar.

### Step 9. Store and Manage JSON

Let's examine the query for creating a single bike. Click "Create a bike" button:

![access json keys](images/stack2.png)

It will display a `JSON.SET` command with model, brand, price, type, specs and description details. `bikes:1` is the name of the Redis key where the JSON is stored.

### Step 10. Accessing parts of a stored JSON document

Click "Get specific fields" to access part of a stored JSON document as shown in the following diagram:
