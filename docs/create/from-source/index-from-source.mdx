### Step 1: Download, extract and compile Redis
 
```
wget http://download.redis.io/redis-stable.tar.gz
tar xvzf redis-stable.tar.gz
cd redis-stable
make
```

It is a good idea to copy both the Redis server and the command line interface into the proper places, either manually using the following commands:

```
sudo cp src/redis-server /usr/local/bin/
sudo cp src/redis-cli /usr/local/bin/
```
Or just using ```sudo make install.```

The binaries that are now compiled are available in the src directory. 


### Step 2: Running Redis Server
 
```
$ redis-server
```

### Step 3: Interacting with Redis Client

```
$ src/redis-cli
redis> set foo bar
OK
redis> get foo
"bar"
```

Please note: By default, Redis has 0-15 indexes for databases, you can change that number databases NUMBER in redis.conf.
