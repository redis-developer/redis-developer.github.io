To install Redis Stack on macOS, use Homebrew. Make sure that you have Homebrew installed before starting on the installation instructions below.



Follow the instructions below to setup Redis Stack on your Mac:

### Step 1. Install Redis Stack using Homebrew

First, tap the Redis Stack Homebrew tap and then run `brew install` as shown below:

 ```bash
  brew tap redis-stack/redis-stack
  brew install --cask redis-stack
 ```

This will install all Redis and Redis Stack binaries. How you run these binaries depends on whether you already have Redis installed on your system.


 ```
  ==> Installing Cask redis-stack-redisinsight
  ==> Moving App 'RedisInsight-preview.app' to '/Applications/RedisInsight-preview.app'
  🍺  redis-stack-redisinsight was successfully installed!
  ==> Installing Cask redis-stack
  🍺  redis-stack was successfully installed!
 ```

:::info INFO

If this is the first time you’ve installed Redis on your system, then all Redis Stack binaries will be installed and accessible from the `$PATH`. On M1 Macs, this assumes that `/opt/homebrew/bin` is in your path. On Intel-based Macs, `/usr/local/bin` should be in your path.

To check this, run:

 ```bash
  echo $PATH
 ```


Then, confirm that the output contains `/opt/homebrew/bin` (M1 Mac) or `/usr/local/bin` (Intel Mac). If these directories are not in the output, see the “Existing Redis installation” instructions below.
:::

### Start Redis Stack Server

You can now start Redis Stack Server as follows:

 ```bash
  redis-stack-server
 ```

### Existing Redis installation

If you have an existing Redis installation on your system, then you’ll need to modify your `PATH` environment variable to ensure that you’re using the latest Redis Stack binaries.

Open the file `~/.bashrc` or `~/zshrc` (depending on your shell), and add the following line.


 ```bash
   export PATH=/usr/local/Caskroom/redis-stack-server/<VERSION>/bin:$PATH
 ```


Go to Applications and click "RedisInsight Preview" to bring up the Redis Desktop GUI tool.




### Step 2. Add Redis database

### Step 3. Enter Redis database details

Add the local Redis database endpoint and port.

### Step 5. Redis for time series


Redis Stack provides you with a native time series data structure. Let's see how a time series might be useful in our bike shop.

As we have multiple physical shops too, alongside our online shop, it could be helpful to have an overview of the sales volume. We will create one time series per shop tracking the total amount of all sales. In addition, we will mark the time series with the appropriate region label, east or west. This kind of representation will allow us to easily query bike sales performance per certain time periods, per shop, per region or across all shops.


Click "Guides" icon (just below the key) in the left sidebar and choose "Redis for the time series" for this demonstration.

### Step 6. Create time series per shop


 ```bash
  TS.CREATE bike_sales_1 DUPLICATE_POLICY SUM LABELS region east compacted no
  TS.CREATE bike_sales_2 DUPLICATE_POLICY SUM LABELS region east compacted no
  TS.CREATE bike_sales_3 DUPLICATE_POLICY SUM LABELS region west compacted no
  TS.CREATE bike_sales_4 DUPLICATE_POLICY SUM LABELS region west compacted no
  TS.CREATE bike_sales_5 DUPLICATE_POLICY SUM LABELS region west compacted no
 ```
As shown in the following query, we make the shop id (1,2,3,4,5) a part of the time series name. You might also notice the `DUPLICATE_POLICY SUM` argument; this describes what should be done when two events in the same time series share the same timestamp: In this case, it would mean that two sales happened at exactly the same time, so the resulting value should be a sum of the two sales amounts.

Since the metrics are collected with a millisecond timestamp, we can compact our time series into sales per hour:

![create time series per shop](images/testredis3.png)

### Step 7. Running the query

![execute the query](images/testredis4.png)

### Step 8. Time series compaction

RedisTimeSeries supports downsampling with the following aggregations: avg, sum, min, max, range, count, first and last. If you want to keep all of your raw data points indefinitely, your data set grows linearly over time. However, if your use case allows you to have less fine-grained data further back in time, downsampling can be applied. This allows you to keep fewer historical data points by aggregating raw data for a given time window using a given aggregation function.

#### Example:


 ```
  TS.CREATERULE bike_sales_5 bike_sales_5_per_day AGGREGATION sum 86400000
 ```

There are two ways to install Redis on Mac OS:

- [Installing Redis from source](/create/from-source/)
- Using Homebrew

Homebrew is the easiest and most flexible way to install Redis on MacOS. It is a package management software for MacOS.
It automates Redis installation process, making it quick and easy to add Redis to your system. 

Follow the below steps to install Redis on Mac OS using brew service:


### Step 1: Install Homebrew

Run the below command to install and start brew service:


 ```bash
  /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
 ```

### Step 2: Install Redis using Homebrew package manager

Follow the below command line to install Redis using brew service:
 
 ```bash
  brew update
  brew install redis
 ```


### Step 3: Start Redis server


Run the below command line to start the Redis database in the background:

 ```bash
  brew services start redis
 ```

In order to run the latest version of Redis, you will need to compil Redis from the source.
[Follow this link](/create/from-source/) to learn more about it.


### Step 4: Test if Redis server is running.

 ```bash
  redis-cli ping
 ```

It should return PONG. This command is often used to test if a connection is still alive.

### Step 5: Launch Redis on system boot


 ```bash
  ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/redis/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
 ```

### Start Redis server via “launchctl” command

```bash
 launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.redis.plist
```

### Step 6: Run Redis service using a redis configuration file 

 ```bash
  redis-server /usr/local/etc/redis.conf
 ```

### Step 7: Interacting with Redis Client

 ```bash
  redis-cli
  redis> set foo bar
  OK
  redis> get foo
  "bar"
 ``` 

Please note: By default, Redis has 0-15 indexes for databases, you can change that number databases NUMBER in redis.conf.



### Step 8: Stop the Redis service

 ```
  brew services stop redis
 ```

### Step 9: Uninstall Redis 

 ```bash
  brew uninstall redis
 ```
