<p>The last thing you want to do after successfully deploying and scaling Redis is to be stuck working on the weekend because performance is down or the service is unavailable!</p>

If you're running a managed service like Redis Cloud, you won't have to worry about these questions as much. But even then, it's still worthwhile to know about certain key Redis metrics.

Some of the question you always want to be able to answer include:
- Is Redis up and running right now?
- Where is my Redis capacity at?
- Is Redis accessible at this moment?
- Is Redis performing the way we expect?
- When failures occur… what exactly happened to Redis?

Then of course you must ask...
- <strong>How can I find this out ahead of time?</strong>

Let's dig into these questions and more as we look into observability with Redis.
