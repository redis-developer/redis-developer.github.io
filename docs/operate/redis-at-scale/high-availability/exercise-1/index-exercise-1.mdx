## Step 1
First let’s create and configure the primary instance. We’ll start with a few configuration changes in its `primary.conf` configuration file.

```bash
$ touch primary.conf  # Create the configuration file
```

Now open the `primary.conf` file with your favorite text editor and set the following configuration directives:

```bash
# Create a strong password here
requirepass a_strong_password

# AUTH password of the primary instance in case this instance becomes a replica
masterauth a_strong_password

# Enable AOF file persistence
appendonly yes

# Choose a name for the AOF file
appendfilename "primary.aof"
```

Finally, let’s start the primary instance:

```bash
$ redis-server ./primary.conf
```

## Step 2
Next, let’s prepare the configuration file for the replica:
```bash
$ touch replica.conf
```
Let’s add some settings to the file we just created:
```bash
# Port on which the replica should run
port 6380

# Address of the primary instance
replicaof 127.0.0.1 6379

# AUTH password of the primary instance
masterauth a_strong_password

# AUTH password for the replica instance
requirepass a_strong_password
```
And let’s start the replica:
```bash
$ redis-server ./replica.conf
```
## Step 3
Open two terminal tabs and use them to start connections to the primary and replica instances:
```bash
# Tab 1 (primary)
$ redis-cli
```
```bash
# Tab 2 (replica)
$ redis-cli -p 6380
```
Authenticate on both tabs by running the command `AUTH` followed by your password:
```bash
AUTH a_strong_password
```

On the second (replica) tab run the `MONITOR` command which will allow you to see every command executed against that instance.

Go back to the first (primary) tab and execute any write command, for example

```bash
127.0.0.1:6379> SET foo bar
```
In the second tab you should see that the command was already sent to the replica:
```bash
1617230062.389077 [0 127.0.0.1:6379] "SELECT" "0"
1617230062.389092 [0 127.0.0.1:6379] "set" "foo" "bar"
```
## Step 4
Keep the instances running, or at least their configuration files around. We’ll need them for the next exercise.
