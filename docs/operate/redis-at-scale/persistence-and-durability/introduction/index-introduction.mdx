<p>Hello! Congrats on completing Section 1. Section 2 is a bit shorter but contains some important information on persistence and durability.</p>

As I am sure you know, Redis serves all data directly from memory. But Redis is also capable of persisting data to disk. Persistence preserves data in the event of a server restart. 

In the following video and exercise, we'll look at the options for persisting data to disk. We'll show you how to enable persistence, and you'll then do a hands-on exercise setting up snapshots of your Redis instance.

Good luck, and we'll see you in the next sections.
