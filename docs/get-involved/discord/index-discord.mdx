## How to get help

Got a question you want answered? Got a problem you can’t figure out? Don’t worry. Happens to the best of us. We have a help system inspired by the one used by the most excellent [Python Discord](https://pythondiscord.com/).

### tl;dr

Ask a question in a channel in :question: **Help: Available**. That channel moves to :raised_hand: **Help: In Use**. Converse, discuss, get an answer. Close the channel with `/close` when you’re done and it moves to :zzz: **Help: Dormant**.

### Full Version

So, we built a help system to make it easier to ask and answer. There are a series of help channels on the server that all start with `help-` followed by a letter in the NATO Phonetic Alphabet (you know, the whole *alfa bravo charlie* thing). There are 26 channels grouped into **Help: Available**, **Help: In Use**, and **Help: Dormant**.

:question: **Help: Available** contains channels that are available for a question. If you have a question, you can claim this channel simply by posting it there. The channel will immediately be moved to *Help: In Use*.

:raised_hand: **Help: In Use** has channels that are being used to answer a question. If you have the answer to a fellow user’s question, post it here. If you asked the question, other users may answer it. If someone has answered your question—or perhaps you answer it yourself—you can close the channel by typing `/close`. Channels will automatically close if they are inactive for 48 hours. Closed channels are moved to *Help: Dormant*.

:zzz:  **Help: Dormant** is for channels that are not currently in use. You can read them—useful as there are lots of answered questions here—but you cannot post to them. When someone claims a channel in *Help: Available*, a random channel is selected from *Help: Dormant* to replace it.
