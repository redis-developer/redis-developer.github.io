RedisInsight provides built-in support for the Redis JSON, Search and Query, Streams, and Time Series features to make it even easier to query, visualize, and interactively manipulate search indexes, streams, and time-series data. Support for JSON on Redis Cluster was introduced for the first time in RedisInsight v1.8.0. With RedisInsight, you can visualize and edit your JSON data flawlessly.

Below steps shows how to get started with Redis JSON using RedisInsight:

### Step 1. Create a free Cloud account

### Step 4. Using RedisInsight

RedisInsight is a visual tool that lets you do both GUI- and CLI-based interactions with your Redis database, and so much more when developing your Redis based application. It is a fully-featured pure Desktop GUI client that provides capabilities to design, develop and optimize your Redis application. It works with any cloud provider as long as you run it on a host with network access to your cloud-based Redis server. It makes it easy to discover cloud databases and configure connection details with a single click. It allows you to automatically add Redis Enterprise Software and Redis Enterprise Cloud databases.

Install RedisInsight v2 on your local system.
Assuming that you already have RedisInsight v2 installed on your MacOS, you can browse through the Applications and click "RedisInsight-v2" to bring up the Redis Desktop GUI tool.

### Step 5. Add Redis database
