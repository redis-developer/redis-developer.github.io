RedisGraph is the first queryable Property Graph database to use sparse matrices to represent the adjacency matrix
in graphs and linear algebra to query the graph. RedisGraph is based on a unique approach and architecture that translates Cypher queries to matrix operations executed over a GraphBLAS engine. This new design allows use cases like social graph operation, fraud detection, and real-time recommendation to be executed 10x – 600x faster than any other graph database. Undoubtedly, it is the fastest graph database that processes complex graph operations in real time, 10x – 600x faster than any other graph database. It primariy shows how your data is connected through multiple visualization integrations including RedisInsight, Linkurious, and Graphileon. 

RedisGraph is a graph database developed from scratch on top of Redis, using the new Redis Modules API to extend Redis with new commands and capabilities. Its main features include: Simple, fast indexing and querying data stored in RAM using memory-efficient custom data structure. Redis Graph is a directed graph where both nodes and relationships are typed - nodes with labels and edges with types. Node/s and edges can and often do contain properties like columns in a SQL-db or keys in a document store.The newer RedisGraph 2.0 benchmark reveals a significant improvements on parallel workload (multiple clients) with a latency improvements up to 6x and throughput improvements up to 5x when performing graph traversals. 

Below are the primary use cases of RedisGraph:

- Recommendation: It allows you to rapidly find connections between your customers and the experiences they want by examining the relationships between them.
- Graph-aided search: It allows you to search for single or multiple words or phrases and execute full-text and linguistic queries and implementation in real time over your graph structure.
- Identity and access management: It allows you to define complex resources access permissions as a graph and enable rapid real-time verification of these permissions with a single query.

## RedisGraph Rust Client

Rust programming language is blazingly fast and memory-efficient: with no runtime or garbage collector, it can power performance-critical services, run on embedded devices, and easily integrate with other languages.  It is an open-source project developed originally at Mozilla Research. The Rust Library is the foundation of portable Rust software, a set of minimal and battle-tested shared abstractions for the broader Rust ecosystem.

redisgraph-rs is an idiomatic Rust client for RedisGraph, the graph database by Redis.This crate parses responses from RedisGraph and converts them into ordinary Rust values. It exposes a very flexible API that allows you to retrieve a single value, a single record or multiple records using only one function: Graph::query.


Follow the steps below to get started with RedisGraph with Rust:

### Step 1. Run RedisMod Docker container

 ```bash
  docker run -p 6379:6379 --name redislabs/redismod
 ```

### Step 2. Verify if RedisGraph module is loaded

 ```bash
  info modules
  # Modules
  module:name=graph,ver=20405,api=1,filters=0,usedby=[],using=[],options=[]
 ```

### Step 3. Install Rust

 ```bash
  brew install rust
 ```

### Step 4. Clone the repository

 ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/malte-v/redisgraph-rs
 ```

### Step 5. Write a rust program 

Copy the below content and save it as "main.rs" under src directory.

 ```rust
  use redis::Client;
  use redisgraph::{Graph, RedisGraphResult};

  fn main() -> RedisGraphResult<()> {
    let client = Client::open("redis://127.0.0.1:6379")?;
    let mut connection = client.get_connection()?;

    let mut graph = Graph::open(connection, "MotoGP".to_string())?;

    // Create six nodes (three riders, three teams) and three relationships between them.
    graph.mutate("CREATE (:Rider {name: 'Valentino Rossi', birth_year: 1979})-[:rides]->(:Team {name: 'Yamaha'}), \
        (:Rider {name:'Dani Pedrosa', birth_year: 1985, height: 1.58})-[:rides]->(:Team {name: 'Honda'}), \
        (:Rider {name:'Andrea Dovizioso', birth_year: 1986, height: 1.67})-[:rides]->(:Team {name: 'Ducati'})")?;

    // Get the names and birth years of all riders in team Yamaha.
    let results: Vec<(String, u32)> = graph.query("MATCH (r:Rider)-[:rides]->(t:Team) WHERE t.name = 'Yamaha' RETURN r.name, r.birth_year")?;
    // Since we know just one rider in our graph rides for team Yamaha,
    // we can also write this and only get the first record:
    let (name, birth_year): (String, u32) = graph.query("MATCH (r:Rider)-[:rides]->(t:Team) WHERE t.name = 'Yamaha' RETURN r.name, r.birth_year")?;
    // Let's now get all the data about the riders we have.
    // Be aware of that we only know the height of some riders, and therefore we use an `Option`:
    let results: Vec<(String, u32, Option<f32>)> = graph.query("MATCH (r:Rider) RETURN r.name, r.birth_year, r.height")?;

    // That was just a demo; we don't need this graph anymore. Let's delete it from the database:
    //graph.delete()?;

    Ok(())

 ```

### Step 6. Run the current local package

 ```
  cargo run
 ```


### Step 7. Monitor the Graph query


 ```bash
  1633515550.109594 [0 172.17.0.1:55114] "GRAPH.QUERY" "MotoGP" "CREATE (dummy:__DUMMY_LABEL__)" "--compact"
  1633515550.111727 [0 172.17.0.1:55114] "GRAPH.QUERY" "MotoGP" "MATCH (dummy:__DUMMY_LABEL__) DELETE dummy" "--compact"
  1633515550.114948 [0 172.17.0.1:55114] "GRAPH.QUERY" "MotoGP" "CREATE (:Rider {name: 'Valentino Rossi', birth_year: 1979})-[:rides]->(:Team {name: 'Yamaha'}), (:Rider {name:'Dani Pedrosa', birth_year: 1985, height: 1.58})-[:rides]->(:Team {name: 'Honda'}), (:Rider {name:'Andrea Dovizioso', birth_year: 1986, height: 1.67})-[:rides]->(:Team {name: 'Ducati'})" "--compact"
  1633515550.118380 [0 172.17.0.1:55114] "GRAPH.QUERY" "MotoGP" "MATCH (r:Rider)-[:rides]->(t:Team) WHERE t.name = 'Yamaha' RETURN r.name, r.birth_year" "--compact"
  1633515550.120766 [0 172.17.0.1:55114] "GRAPH.QUERY" "MotoGP" "MATCH (r:Rider)-[:rides]->(t:Team) WHERE t.name = 'Yamaha' RETURN r.name, r.birth_year" "--compact"
  1633515550.122505 [0 172.17.0.1:55114] "GRAPH.QUERY" "MotoGP" "MATCH (r:Rider) RETURN r.name, r.birth_year, r.height" "--compact"
  1633515550.124045 [0 172.17.0.1:55114] "GRAPH.DELETE" "MotoGP"

 ```



### Step 8. Install RedisInsight

[Follow this link to install RedisInsight](/explore/redisinsight/getting-started). For this demo, we will be using RedisInsight Docker container as shown below:

 ```bash
  docker run -d -v redisinsight:/db -p 8001:8001 redislabs/redisinsight:latest
 ```

### Step 8. Accessing RedisInsight

Next, point your browser to http://localhost:8001.


### Step 9. Run the Graph Query

You can use the limit clause to limit the number of records returned by a query:

 ```bash
  GRAPH.QUERY "MotoGP" "MATCH (r:Rider) RETURN r.name, r.birth_year, r.height"
 ```
