RedisInsight provides built-in support for the RedisJSON, RediSearch, RedisGraph, Redis Streams, and RedisTimeSeries modules to make it even easier to query, visualize, and interactively manipulate search indexes, graphs, streams, and time-series data. Support for RedisJSON on Redis Cluster was introduced for the first time in RedisInsight v1.8.0. With RedisInsight, you can visualize and edit your JSON data flawlessly.


Below steps shows how to get started with RedisJSON using RedisInsight:

### Step 1. Register and subscribe
