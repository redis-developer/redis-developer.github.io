### Step 1. Create Redis Enterprise Cloud

Create your free Redis Enterprise Cloud account. [Follow this link to create Redis Enterprise Cloud](/create/rediscloud) subscription and database as shown below:

![heroku](rediscloud.png)

Save the database endpoint URL and password for future reference.


### Step 2. Create a Heroku account

If you are using Heroku for the first time, create your new Heroku account [through this link](https://signup.heroku.com/login)

### Step 3. Install Heroku CLI on your system

   ```macos
    brew install heroku
   ```

### Step 4. Login to Heroku

   ```bash
    heroku login
    heroku: Press any key to open up the browser to login or q to exit:
    Opening browser to https://cli-auth.heroku.com/auth/cli/browser/XXXXXXXXXXA
    Logging in... done
    Logged in as your_email_address
   ```

### Step 5. Connect your application to Redis Enterprise Cloud

For this demonstration, we will be using a [Sample Rate Limiting application](https://github.com/redis-developer/basic-rate-limiting-demo-nodejs)

#### Clone the repository

   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/redis-developer/basic-redis-rate-limiting-demo-nodejs
   ```



Run the below CLI to have a functioning Git repository that contains a simple application as well as a package.json file.


```
heroku create
Creating app... done, ⬢ rocky-lowlands-06306
https://rocky-lowlands-06306.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/rocky-lowlands-06306.git
```



### Step 6. Setting up Environmental variable

Go to Heroku dashboard, click "Settings" and set REDIS_ENDPOINT_URI and REDIS_PASSWORD under the Config Vars.
Refer to Step 1 for the reference.

You now have a functioning Git repository that contains a simple application as well as a package.json file, which is used by Node’s dependency manager.




### Step 7. Deploy your code


```
$ git push heroku
```

Wait for few seconds and you will see the below messages being displayed:

```
remote: -----> Launching...
remote:        Released v3
remote:        https://rocky-lowlands-06306.herokuapp.com/ deployed to Heroku
remote: 
remote: Verifying deploy... done.
To https://git.heroku.com/rocky-lowlands-06306.git
 * [new branch]      main -> main

```

### Step 8. Accessing the application


Open https://rocky-lowlands-06306.herokuapp.com/   to see your application
