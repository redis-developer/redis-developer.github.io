Find tutorials, examples and technical articles that will help you to develop with Redis and Php.


### Getting Started

In order to use Redis with PHP you will need a PHP Redis client. In the following sections, we will demonstrate the use of [PhpRedis](https://github.com/phpredis/phpredis), a flexible and feature-complete Redis client library for PHP. Additional [PHP clients](http://redis.io/clients#PHP) for Redis can be found under the PHP section of the Redis Clients page.

Redis is an open source, in-memory, key-value data store most commonly used as a primary database, cache, message broker, and queue. Redis delivers sub-millisecond response times, enabling fast and powerful real-time applications in industries such as gaming, fintech, ad-tech, social media, healthcare, and IoT.


#### Step 1. Run a Redis server

You can either run Redis in a Docker container or directly on your Mac OS.
Follow the below commands to setup a Redis server locally:


```
 brew tap redis-stack/redis-stack
 brew install --cask redis-stack
```

:::info INFO
Redis Stack unifies and simplifies the developer experience of the leading Redis modules and the capabilities they provide. Redis Stack bundles five Redis modules: RedisJSON, RedisSearch, RedisGraph, RedisTimeSeries, and RedisBloom.

:::


Ensure that you are able to use the following Redis command to connect to the Redis instance.

```bash
 redis-cli -h localhost -p 6379
 localhost>
```


### Step 2. Get pecl 


```
apt install pkg-php-tools
```



### Step 2. Install PhpRedis
 
```
pecl install redis
```

### Step 3. Opening a Connection to Redis Using PhpRredis

The following code creates a connection to Redis using Phpredis

```php
<?php
 
$redis = new Redis();
//Connecting to Redis
$redis->connect('hostname', port);
$redis->auth('password');
 
if ($redis->ping()) {
 echo "PONGn";
}
 
?>
```

Replace the following values with those of your database and save this file as connect.php

### Step 4. Executing the script

```
php connect.php
```

It should display "PONG" as output. You can verify this by running the monitor command

```
127.0.0.1:6379> monitor
OK
1614778301.165001 [0 [::1]:57666] "PING"
```
