# Getting Started with redis-rs


Rust community has built many client libraries that you can find here. For your first steps with Java and Rust, this article will show how to use a popula library: redis-rs 
The web page “Redis Enterprise and Rust” will help you to get started with Redis Enterprise and Rust in a much easier manner.
redis-rs is a rust implementation of a Redis client library. 
It exposes a general purpose interface to Redis and also provides specific helpers for commonly used functionality.

1. Install Rust

       ```bash
        curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
       ```

2. Configure your current shell:
 
       ```bash
        source $HOME/.cargo/env
       ```

3. Verify Rust compiler:
 
       ```bash
        rustc --version
        rustc 1.49.0
       ```

4. Creating Cargo.toml with Redis dependency:
 
       ```bash
        [dependencies]
        redis = "0.8.0"
       ```


5. Clone the repository

       ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/redis-developer/redis-rust-getting-started
       ```

 
6. Run the application
   
     ```bash
      cargo run
     ```
