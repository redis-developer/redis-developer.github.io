Thanks for taking the time to complete this course. We hope that you found it useful and that you've learned a few things about using Redis as a data store and as a cache in your Node.js applications.

Don't forget that the application [source code is available on GitHub](https://github.com/redislabs-training/node-js-crash-course/) for you to browse and use in your own projects.

Stay in touch! We'd love to hear from you and see what you build with Redis. Why not [join us on Discord](https://discord.gg/redis) and [subscribe to our YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/redisinc) where we publish new videos regularly.

Finally, if you'd like to continue your learning journey, check out [Redis University](https://university.redis.com) for free, self-paced online courses.
